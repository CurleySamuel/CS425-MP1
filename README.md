# CS425-MP1
In this MP, you will need to implement a Key-Value storage system over a network with delays.

Your storage should be composed of 4 servers, each server may potentially store the value for
each key in the shared datastore. Use positive integers as Key and Value both.

This MP involves two steps. The first step will be implementing communication between servers.

Step two will be implementing Key-Value Store with different consistency models. Step two is built upon step one. Also, step two involves more work and credit than step one, please plan
accordingly.
