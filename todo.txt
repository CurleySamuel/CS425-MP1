- Implement Eventual Consistency.
- Implement the "search Key" utility function.
- Need to change delay from comprehensive across all channels to channel specific delay (A->B: 5, B->C: 2).
- Clean up the console output.
- Confirm models are working.
- Instead of opening/closing sockets every connection, open a single socket for each server and have the network "select" on them.

Misc.
- Add timestamp to network's output for readability.
- Possibly change our totally, casually, fifo broadcast to just totally ordered.
