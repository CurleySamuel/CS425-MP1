- Implement Eventual Consistency.
- Implement the "search Key" utility function.
- Clean up the console output.
- Confirm models are working.
- Instead of opening/closing sockets every connection, open a single socket for each server and have the network "select" on them.

Misc.
- Add timestamp to network's output for readability.
- Possibly change our totally, casually, fifo broadcast to just totally ordered.



1. SEND/BCAST is broken.

2. I'll put this in the todo, but you need to move some elements around in your acks
msg[0] used to be the origin server's port
But you're using it as the server which you should ack for
Which creates this
Sent insert (D -> C)
Sent insert (D -> D)
Sent insert (D -> A)
Sent insert (D -> B)
Sent ack (D -> A)
Sent ack (D -> B)
Sent ack (D -> C)
Sent ack (D -> D)
Should make it...
bcast 48504 ack a 5 2 03:40:23 03:40:23
bcast 48502 ack 48504 a 5 2 03:40:23 03:40:23
